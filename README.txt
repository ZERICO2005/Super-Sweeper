Super-Sweeper Windows Edition v0.78.0
zerico2005 | 2023/12/16

Super-Sweeper Windows Edition is a port of Super-Sweeper for the Ti84CE.

Super-Sweeper v0.77.0 was ported to Windows on June 3rd 2023. Super-Sweeper v0.77.1 has most of the source code unchanged apart from some formating and a minor bug fix. The source code is not too great because I coded Super Sweeper before I knew how to have multiple C files in a program. Super-Sweeper v0.77.2 onwards will introduce new and improved code as I have gotten better at C/C++ overtime.

Also included are the programs I used to generate the menus and videos.

Controls:
	Arrows: Move
	WASD: Move
	Enter: Enter
	E: Search Tile/Enter
	Q: Flag Tile
	Z: Mark Tile
	X: Menu
	C: Auto Solver (Must be enabled in the menu)
	P: Exit Application
